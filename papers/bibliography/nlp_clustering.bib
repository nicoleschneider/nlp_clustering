    abstract = {The experimental evidence accumulated over the past 20 years indicates that text indexing systems based on the assignment of appropriately weighted single terms produce retrieval results that are superior to those obtainable with other more elaborate text representations. These results depend crucially on the choice of effective termweighting systems. This article summarizes the insights gained in automatic term weighting, and provides baseline single-term-indexing models with which other more elaborate content analysis procedures can be compared.}

Such similarity can be useful for a variety of applications including cross-lingual information retrieval and cross-lingual text classification. To compute similarity, we focus on neural machine translation models and examine the utility of their intermediate states. Through experiments on an English-Japanese translation corpus, it is demonstrated that the intermediate states of input texts are indeed beneficial for computing cross-lingual text similarity, outperforming other approaches including a strong machine translation-based baseline.},

abstract = {The multilingual world needs systems that can cluster text written in multiple languages into the same thread or topic. Clustering multilingual text can be accomplished by translating and then clustering text in a canonical language, using multilingual embeddings to cluster articles in a shared embedding space, and via other language-independent methods. The performance and pitfalls of these various methods have not been well studied in the context of real-time clustering across documents written in many languages. We address this problem by generating a large dataset of news articles using a reference architecture that continuously indexed and clustered articles spanning 17 languages over the last 15 years. Through the analysis of these documents and their clusters, the clustering quality is shown to be dependent on the normalization of proper nouns, the types of georeferences, and the overall geographic focus of the document.},

These varied mediums present valuable research opportunities to gain insights into emerging trends. We present BroadcastStand, an extension framework for the NewsStand architecture, which traditionally focuses on online news articles and Twitter posts. Our objective is to seamlessly integrate a new genre of news data: radio and TV broadcasts. We show how these transcripts fit into the previous clustering landscape of traditional news data and highlight key insights that will drive future research in aggregating various news sources to increase the dimensions across which analysis can be done. In particular, we highlight the value in clustering these various sources of news data and highlight certain key pitfalls that must be addressed to obtain good clustering results.},

Existing approaches to semi-supervised clustering require a significant amount of feedback from an expert to improve the clusters. In this paper, we ask whether a large language model (LLM) can amplify an expert{'}s guidance to enable query-efficient, few-shot semi-supervised text clustering. We show that LLMs are surprisingly effective at improving clustering. We explore three stages where LLMs can be incorporated into clustering: before clustering (improving input features), during clustering (by providing constraints to the clusterer), and after clustering (using LLMs post-correction). We find that incorporating LLMs in the first two stages routinely provides significant improvements in cluster quality, and that LLMs enable a user to make trade-offs between cost and accuracy to produce desired clusters. We release our code and LLM prompts for the public to use.1",

    abstract = "The time at which a message is communicated is a vital piece of metadata in many real-world natural language processing tasks such as Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT). TDT systems aim to cluster a corpus of news articles by event, and in that context, stories that describe the same event are likely to have been written at around the same time. Prior work on time modeling for TDT takes this into account, but does not well capture how time interacts with the semantic nature of the event. For example, stories about a tropical storm are likely to be written within a short time interval, while stories about a movie release may appear over weeks or months. In our work, we design a neural method that fuses temporal and textual information into a single representation of news documents for event detection. We fine-tune these time-aware document embeddings with a triplet loss architecture, integrate the model into downstream TDT systems, and evaluate the systems on two benchmark TDT data sets in English. In the retrospective setting, we apply clustering algorithms to the time-aware embeddings and show substantial improvements over baselines on the News2013 data set. In the online streaming setting, we add our document encoder to an existing state-of-the-art TDT pipeline and demonstrate that it can benefit the overall performance. We conduct ablation studies on the time representation and fusion algorithm strategies, showing that our proposed model outperforms alternative strategies. Finally, we probe the model to examine how it handles recurring events more effectively than previous TDT systems.",
