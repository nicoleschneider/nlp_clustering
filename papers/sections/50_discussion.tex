\subsection{Ground-Truth Single Language Clustering Setting}
\nrscomment{below is an example, adjust based on results}
A very high precision and low recall indicate that the clustering results may be overly cautious, not grouping data points together unless they are quite similar and certainly refer to the same news event. 
This suggests that while the clustering method is effective at grouping related articles together, it may also be prone to not including potentially relevant articles within those clusters.



\subsection{Cross-Lingual Clustering}

\nrscomment{interpret the cluster visualization}

\nrscomment{discuss the significance of cluster assignment quality based on qualitative results, which was better baseline or LLM and why}



\subsection{Cross-Lingual Keyphrase Extraction}
\nrscomment{discuss significance of LLM extracting proper nouns and corroborating findings of original paper or extracting something else, and why}



\subsection{Cross-Lingual Cluster Correction}
\nrscomment{discuss significance of improvement gained through cluster correction, by language.}
